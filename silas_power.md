title: Silas' Power
---

Through a strange (and perhaps sinister) experiment, Silas Riversong has gained the ability to change his physical form on command. This transformation has two variants.

---

***Simple transformation.*** Silas may change his appearance to match any humanoid he has seen recently. The humanoid must be the same size as Silas. This transformation is cosmetic only, and does not affect Silas' equipped weapons or armor. The transformation will hold up to basic physical inspection, but Silas is only able to mimic characteristics he has directly observed. While transformed, Silas speaks with his own voice.

Certain factors may make Silas' imitation less plausible, requiring him and/or the person he's interacting with to make relevant skill checks. Examples include:
- Characteristics that Silas has not observed.
	- *Example: The person being imitated has a tattoo on their wrist, but when Silas observed them, the tattoo was concealed.*
- Characteristics that Silas is totally unable to imitate even if observed.
	- *Example: The person being imitated wears a unique set of armor, but Silas cannot imitate worn items.*
- Demonstrations of skills or proficiencies that the imitated person is expected to have, but Silas does not. 
	- *Example: The person being imitated is expected to be a master swordsman, but Silas only knows basic sword maneuvers.*
- Demonstrations of knowledge that the imitated person is expected to have, but Silas does not.
	- *Example: The person being imitated is expected to be a master of History, but Silas only has surface-level knowledge of History.*
- Conflicting evidence.
	- *Example: The person being imitated died shortly after Silas observed them, and others are aware of this.*

As an ability, ***Simple transformation*** has the following characteristics:
- The ability may be used at the cost of an Action, and behaves like a Cantrip.
- The ability's effect lasts for one hour. It may be dismissed early at the cost of an Action.
- Silas may use the ability to transform into any humanoid he has observed since his last Long Rest. There is no limit to how many humanoids Silas can "remember" in this way, but all are forgotten upon taking a Long Rest.

---

***Enhanced transformation.*** In certain circumstances, Silas may imbue his transformation with additional energy, allowing him to more completely imitate a humanoid. This enhanced transformation requires recent physical contact with the humanoid. When performing an enhanced transformation, Silas will take on the following characteristics of the person being mimicked:
- Physical appearance and voice.
	- This aspect of the transformation is **complete** and includes characteristics Silas has not directly observed.
- Ability scores and modifiers. 
- Modifiers related to spellcasting.
- Spellcasting ability.
- Cantrips. 
- Spells that were prepared at time of contact.

Silas retains his own skill proficiencies, proficiency bonus, spell slots, feats, and attributes related to equipped or carried items. Any gained cantrips and prepared spells are added to his own, though he may not necessarily be able to cast them. Additionally, features that are specific to the class or subclass of the targeted person are not gained by Silas. 

As an ability, ***Enhanced transformation*** has the following characteristics:
- The ability may be used at the cost of an Action, and behaves like a Levelled Spell.
- The ability's effect lasts for one hour. It may be dismissed early at the cost of an Action.
- The ability may be used once per Long Rest. 
	- At Level 7, this becomes a Short Rest.
- Silas may use the ability to transform into any humanoid he has made physical contact with since his last Long Rest. There is no limit to how many humanoids Silas can "remember" in this way, but all are forgotten upon taking a Long Rest.
	- At Level 5, Silas may identify a humanoid to be *permanently* remembered. This humanoid must have previously been the target of an ***Enhanced transformation***.
	- At Level 9, Silas may identify a second humanoid in this way. 
- Because of the additional energy required to invoke this ability, upon the conclusion of the ability's effect (whether on its own or dismissed early), Silas gains a point of exhaustion.
