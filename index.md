# Party Members
## Alastar Vale
- Wood Elf
- Level 1 Paladin

Alastar Vale grew up in the city of Easton Hope, located on the island of Nog just south of the Ch'inguan mainland. Alastar is the last surviving member of House Vale, a Ch'inguan Noble House that was wiped out in a violent attack that also destroyed their city. Although reasonably educated as a youth of nobility, Alastar seeks to further develop his knowledge of history, in the hopes of discovering who was behind his family's murder and the destruction of his home. On this journey, Alastar is tutored and guided by Professor Aligar.

## Astrid Dreamspire
- High Elf
- Level 1 Cleric

Astrid Dreamspire originated in the Fell Desert, a largely inhospitable land in the southwest of Arania. Unlike many who come to The Academy seeking to learn skills to take back to their homeland or use for employment, Astrid explicitly seeks to become a Master in a discipline of her own design. Inspired by the resiliency of her people, Astrid carries herself as a healer, and seeks to study medicine and related magics under Professor Mirias. 

## Elowen Thornblade
- Aasimar
- Level 1 Druid

Elowen Thornblade is a Druid from the northern forests, near the West Cretian city of Al-Had. A hermit by nature, Elowen has spent much of her life wandering the continent of Arania, developing a strong connection with nature and generally shunning connection with other peoples. She came to the Academy mostly by chance, and is largely disinterested in the formalities of study and scholarship. For the time being, she has chosen to study the protective magics of Abjuration, Enchantment, and Illusion with Professor Zenarei. 

## Icarus Zenwind
- Human
- Level 1 Monk

Icarus Zenwind is a Monk from the western regions of Arania, growing up in the free city of *somewhere.* When he came of age, Icarus departed his home for a monastery in the mountains north of Lakeshore, just near the border with Ch'ingua. Since then, he has lived in seclusion, honing his skills in martial arts while simultaneously mastering his inner self. Icarus came to the Academy to study warcraft and strategy under the tutelage of Professor Berak. 

## Silas Riversong
- Human
- Level 1 Bard

Silas Riversong is a Bard, hailing from an unknown part of Arania. Against his will, Silas was the target of arcane experimentation in his youth, granting him the power to transform his appearance at will. Over time, Silas has honed this ability, occasionally allowing him to take on the attributes and traits of those he would mimic. He has developed a plethora of proficiencies across many disciplines, but his frequent shapeshifting has left him with a rather weak constitution in his normal form. Silas arrived at the Academy to further develop his combat skills, studying under Professor Berak.
