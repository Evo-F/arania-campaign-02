# Narrative Hook
It is the year 225 of the 3rd Cycle. The Academy of Jinsport, a renowned educational institution, has received a grant from the Confederacy to establish a dormitory on their grounds. This dormitory would enable students and scholars to reside on Academy grounds, reducing the barrier of entry to the institution.

In keeping with the doctrine of "True Neutrality" espoused by both Jin's Confederacy and The Academy, a lottery system is established to determine which of the many applicants will be able to live in the dormitory. Rooms in the dormitory are normally double-occupancy, but due to increased demand, the possibility for triple-occupancy does exist provided all residents are amenable. 

Remaining in the dormitories long-term is contingent on maintaining good standing with The Academy and the Confederacy. For The Academy, this means diligently attending to one's studies and faculty assignments. For the Confederacy, it is not yet clear what this means. 

# Chosen Course of Study
Although The Academy does not have strictly-defined courses of study, students are nevertheless encouraged to focus their studies in specific areas of interest. This in turn will determine which member of the faculty is assigned as an advisor to each student - it is ultimately this academic advisor who is responsible for evaluating a student's proficiency (or mastery) of a subject area.

Currently, the major recognized areas of study (and respective advisors) are:
- History - Professor Aligar (Dragonborn, M)
- Business - Professor Jorieth (Elf, F)
- Rhetoric - Professor Mirias (Human, F)
- Smithing - Professor Goldshield (Dwarf, M)
- Music - Professor Venfir (Half-Elf, M)
- Warcraft, Combat - Professor Berak (Half-Orc, M)
- Magic
	- Conjuration, Necromancy, Transmutation - Professor Aranmos (Tiefling, M)
	- Abjuration, Enchantment, Illusion - Professor Zenarei (Tiefling, F)
	- Divination, Evocation - Professor Krisven (Half-Elf, F)

# Dorm Lottery
To determine the results of the housing lottery, each member of the Party should roll 1d20 against a DC10. On a success, the person has "won" the lottery and invited to stay in the dormitory. On a failure, the person may opt to find alternative housing in the nearby city of Jinsport (which will incur a regular cost for rent), or they may wish to go before the Bursar and plead their case. There is no consequence for failing to convince the Bursar. 

## Housing in Jinsport
Because of its economic prosperity, Jinsport features a number of different housing options, though they incur different costs. The exact nature of the housing can be determined on the fly.

In Jinsport, housing can generally be broken into three tiers, with approximate rents assigned accordingly. Rent is due on the 1st of the month. 
- Poor Accommodation - 5 GP
- Normal Accommodation - 15 GP
- Quality Accommodation - 20 GP

Renters have until the next rent due date to pay any outstanding rent. If rent comes due and the renter has any outstanding rent, they will be evicted.

## Convincing the Bursar
To convince the Bursar, the player will need to choose their approach beforehand and make three relevant checks throughout the encounter, with the final result being the sum of these three checks. The DC of the entire encounter is 30. 

## Room Assignments
Once all players have secured housing, they will need to decide who is living with whom. Rooms in the dorms are double-occupancy, with triple-occupancy being possible if everyone agrees.
