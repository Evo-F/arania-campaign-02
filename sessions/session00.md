# Narrative Hook
It is the year 225 of the 3rd Cycle. The Academy of Jinsport, a renowned educational institution, has received a grant from the Confederacy to establish a dormitory on their grounds. This dormitory would enable students and scholars to reside on Academy grounds, reducing the barrier of entry to the institution.

In keeping with the doctrine of "True Neutrality" espoused by both Jin's Confederacy and The Academy, a lottery system is established to determine which of the many applicants will be able to live in the dormitory. Rooms in the dormitory are normally double-occupancy, but due to increased demand, the possibility for triple-occupancy does exist provided all residents are amenable. 

Remaining in the dormitories long-term is contingent on maintaining good standing with The Academy and the Confederacy. For The Academy, this means diligently attending to one's studies and faculty assignments. For the Confederacy, it is not yet clear what this means. 

# Chosen Course of Study
Although The Academy does not have strictly-defined courses of study, students are nevertheless encouraged to focus their studies in specific areas of interest. This in turn will determine which member of the faculty is assigned as an advisor to each student - it is ultimately this academic advisor who is responsible for evaluating a student's proficiency (or mastery) of a subject area.

Currently, the major recognized areas of study (and respective advisors) are:
- History - Professor Aligar (Dragonborn, M)
- Business - Professor Jorieth (Elf, F)
- Rhetoric - Professor Mirias (Human, F)
- Smithing - Professor Goldshield (Dwarf, M)
- Music - Professor Venfir (Half-Elf, M)
- Warcraft, Combat - Professor Berak (Half-Orc, M)
- Magic
	- Conjuration, Necromancy, Transmutation - Professor Aranmos (Tiefling, M)
	- Abjuration, Enchantment, Illusion - Professor Zenarei (Tiefling, F)
	- Divination, Evocation - Professor Krisven (Half-Elf, F)
