# Summary
In this first session, the Party is introduced to one another as students at The Academy. For the first time in its history, The Academy is offering residential accommodations to students, but in the interest of fairness, students must participate in a lottery to obtain space in a dormitory.
- **Astrid Dreamspire** and **Alastar Vale** won the lottery and received space in the dormitories.
- **Silas Riversong** lost the lottery, but after some convincing and demonstration of his unique abilities, the Bursar relented and granted him space in the dormitories.
- **Icarus Zenwind** lost the lottery, and initially opted to live off the land around The Academy, despite his general lack of survival skills.
- **Elowen Thornblade** had no interest in participating in the lottery, and opted to live off the land around The Academy in keeping with her isolated hermit ways.

# Combat Proficiency Exam
In order to enter The Academy proper, the overseers of the school have instituted a mandatory combat proficiency exam. This is to prove that prospective students, especially those living on campus, are capable of defending themselves (and The Academy itself if necessary). 

This exam is not meant to seriously harm prospective students, as they spar in a controlled arena with one or more sets of magically Animated Armor.

The Party took to the mat, and although initially skeptical of one another, they quickly learned to fight as a team and were able to defeat the Armor. Several deft *Longsword* strikes from Alastar and collateral damage from Elowen's *Ice Knife* were enough to bring down the practice dummies, aided by Astrid's *Shield of Faith* and Silas' *Vicious Mockery*. Regrettably, Icarus was incapacitated during the fight, failing to land any blows with his *Spear*. 
- This incapacitation led the Bursar to evaluate Icarus as a potential liability, and so mandated his residency in the dormitories for his own protection.
- Icarus was required to room with another student of his choice, and he chose to room with Alastar Vale.
