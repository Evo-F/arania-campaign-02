# Summary
The Party has had a relatively uneventful first week at The Academy, taking the time to settle in and become familiar with their surroundings. Aside from their initial combat proficiency exam, the students have not crossed paths with each other too often, and so have been mostly left to their own devices:
- **Alastar Vale**, when not adjusting to his new roommate situation, has been spending most of his time in The Academy's library, independently researching the history of the Aranian mainland (particularly the kingdom of Ch'ingua) as well as tangentially reading up on magical artifacts.
- **Astrid Dreamspire** has spent the week establishing connections with as many professors and senior students as she could. Although she has caught on well with her advisor, she remains in pursuit of every opportunity to accelerate her advancement.
- **Elowen Thornblade** has remained distant from the other students, preferring instead to maintain her solitude in the wilderness around The Academy. She has periodically ventured onto school grounds, but mainly out of curiosity. 
- **Icarus Zenwind**, when not enthusiastically bonding with his cool new roommate, has spent most of the week meditating in quiet solitude in order to develop his connection with himself. When not meditating, Icarus has also been in the school library, taking out various tomes on ancient military strategy and self-development.
- **Silas Riversong** has been the most socially active of the bunch, establishing friendships with as many people as he can physically speak to. At every introduction, he makes sure to shake hands with his new friend. 

# The First Assignment
Although The Academy lacks a formal course of study, the start of the second week of any new year is typically when faculty advisors issue their first true assignments to their students. These initial assignments are typically the first test of a student's character and initiative, and almost always involve them leaving Academy grounds for a period of time. As it happens, all five members of The Party have been dispatched to the nearby town of Drayside:
- **Alastar** is to collect some correspondence from the mainland. It is implied by Professor Aligar that this correspondence is sensitive and has some direct relevance to Alastar.
- **Astrid** is to collect a bulk order of 10 Potions of Healing, to be used in experiments. Professor Mirias intends to test new methods of strengthening and amplifying the potions. 
- **Elowen** is to collect an Amulet of Minor Warding ^[Increases the wearer's Armor Class by 1 when worn.], a minor magical artifact that produces a gentle force to deflect blows away from the wearer. It is unclear why Professor Zenarei needs this Amulet.
- **Icarus** is to return a collection of books that were loaned to Professor Berak from a bookstore. These books were meant to be returned several years ago.
- **Silas** is to collect a custom-made Greatclub from a weaponsmith that Professor Berak has some rapport with. Although such implements are typically meant to be ornamental, Professor Berak intends to use it as a proper weapon; it is not clear why.

With their assignments duly noted, the Party set off on the road to Drayside.

# Unforeseen Delay
Although the trip to Drayside should have been complete by sunset, the Party was delayed on the road (for one reason or another) by Alastar. As a result, the sun began to set while the Party was still on the road, with Drayside nowhere in sight. Before the Party could decide whether to make camp or press on through the night, they were interrupted by a rustling in the underbrush.

Elowen's time spent in the wilderness allowed her to easily identify the sound - the Party was about to encounter a Dire Wolf. However, her assessment was not entirely correct, as the students soon came face to face with not just one, but *two* such beasts. 

Dire Wolves in this part of Arania are not necessarily aggressive, but they are fiercely territorial. There was no chance of the Party coming any closer to the beasts, but for the moment, they were standing their ground. As such, Elowen elected to try and communicate with the Dire Wolves using her *Speak with Animals* spell. At first, Elowen tried to persuade them to join the Party for the purposes of protection, but the Wolves were not persuaded; they were similarly not persuaded to simply get out of the way. 

At this stalemate, Silas had an idea - using his *Mage Hand*, he would try to lure the Dire Wolves off the road using a portion of Alastar's rations. While the rations did get the Wolves' attention, one of the wolves was able to quickly snap the rations right out of Silas' spectral hand, removing the distraction entirely. A fight was inevitable.
